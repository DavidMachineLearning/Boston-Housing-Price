# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
This repository is intended to be a simple example for regression model.
This project is usefull for beginners who are just getting started with Machine Learning as well as being a reference for people which are currently enrolled in the Machine Learning Nanodegree.

# Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

# Requirements

Python 3 (Tested on python 3.7.3)

sklearn     0.21.2

scipy       1.4.1

matplotlib  3.1.0

numpy       1.16.5

pandas      0.24.2

jupyter     1.0.0


# Project Overview

Apply machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home.

Explore the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset.

Analyze performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes.

Finally, test the optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to the statistics.
