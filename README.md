# Project Overview

Apply machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home.

Explore the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset.

Analyze performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes.

Finally, test the optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to the statistics.
